                <p><strong>Terms of publication of the manuscript</strong></p>
            <p>International Journal of Biology and Chemistry is published two times a year in the online (electronic) format in the following terms of publication of the journal's issues: the first issue is published until June 20, the second issue – until December 20 of the current year.</p>
            <p>Articles, that have not been previously published by the author(s), which correspond to the thematic areas of the journal and are formatted strictly according to the requirements of the manuscript, are accepted for publication in the International Journal of Biology and Chemistry.</p>
            <p>The manuscript of a scientific article is submitted to the editorial board by the corresponding author (determined from the number of the author's collective of the manuscript if there are 2 or more co-authors) at least two months before the next issue of the journal is published. Manuscripts of at least 1,500 words and no more than 7,000 words (excluding title, information about authors, abstract, keywords, references, acknowledgment) are accepted for publication in the journal.</p>
            <p>The manuscript must be uploaded via the electronic platform by the corresponding author, indicating all the metadata of the article and its authors. Articles by the same author (prepared individually or in co-authorship) may be published in the journal no more than once during a calendar year.</p>
            <p>Authors must submit to the editorial office an original work that has not been previously published in other publications (in print, electronic, and other open sources). The authors are responsible for the reliability, novelty, and evidence of the research results. At the stage of consideration of the manuscript by the editorial board and reviewers of the International Journal of Biology and Chemistry, as well as after its publication, the authors must not submit this manuscript for consideration for publication in another edition.</p>
            <p>At the stages of working with a manuscript, communication between the editorial office, the corresponding author, and reviewers is carried out via the electronic (online) platform OJS, and in exceptional cases – via e-mail.</p>

            <p>The editorial board of the International Journal of Biology and Chemistry, when reviewing the manuscript for compliance with the formal requirements (manuscript requirement), also checks for the presence of borrowed text in the manuscript through a plagiarism checker system, access to which is provided by a university subscription or based on a national subscription.</p>
            <p>Only original manuscripts and/or those manuscripts in which, according to the results of verification by the plagiarism system, originality is more than 75% are sent for further review. If the manuscript does not meet the requirements of the journal and is not an original work based on the results of a plagiarism check, the manuscript is returned to the corresponding author for making the appropriate changes and resubmitting the manuscript for review by the editorial board through the electronic platform of the journal.</p>
            <p>If the authors, while writing the manuscript, used works, articles, provisions, or quotes and statements of other researchers, they must necessarily refer to the works of these scientists and correctly format the quoted text. Plagiarism seems to be an unethical act that violates the Code of Ethics principles of the scientist of al-Farabi KazNU and is unacceptable in the International Journal of Biology and Chemistry.</p>
            <p>Persons involved in the publishing process, especially members of the editorial board of the journal, to ensure the high quality of scientific publications, to avoid unfair practices in publishing activities, such as the use of false information, falsification of data, etc., to ensure recognition society of scientific achievements, undertake to comply with the principles, standards, and norms of scientific ethics adopted by the international community and at al-Farabi KazNU, as well as take measures to prevent such violations.</p>

            <p>The author(s) of the article, in which a provable fact of violation of the principles, standards, and norms of scientific ethics was discovered, are not allowed to submit articles to the journal International Journal of Biology and Chemistry and in other scientific journals of al-Farabi KazNU, within the next three calendar years from the date of revealing the fact(s) of violation of the principles of ethics.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<strong>Peer</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>review process</strong></p>
            <p>The manuscripts received by the editorial office of the journal and meeting the formal requirements, design requirements, and the indicator of originality based on verification through the plagiarism system, are sent for further review.</p>
            <p>If the author(s) of the manuscript has a conflict of interest with other scientists, they must indicate the existence of such a conflict of interest in the cover letter, to avoid sending this manuscript to the specified scientist (reviewer) and biased assessments of the manuscript.</p>
            <p>The International Journal of Biology and Chemistry employs “double-blind peer review” by at least two scientists with the academic degree of Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science, Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), and scientific specialization on the subject of the peer-reviewed manuscript.</p>
            <p>Reviewing is carried out confidentially: the manuscript of the article is sent to reviewers through the electronic platform of the journal without specifying information about the authors. Reviewers are required to have a clear, objective, and reasoned assessment of the compliance of the manuscript with the main scientific criteria, as well as its quality of significance.</p>
            <p>After receiving the conclusions from the reviewers, the executive editor sends them to the corresponding author without specifying information about the reviewers, for responding to comments, making appropriate changes, and resubmitting the manuscript via the electronic platform. The author(s) may make changes to the manuscript and resubmit it to the journal's editorial office or, without explanation, refuse to reply to comments.</p>
            <p>After responding to all the comments, making changes to the manuscript to eliminate the comments of the reviewers, and re-submitting it to the editorial office of the journal by the author(s), the scientific editor sends all materials to the reviewer(s) for re-review.</p>
            <p>The manuscript, on which there are positive opinions from two reviewers and the executive editor, is recommended for publication in the International Journal of Biology and Chemistry according to the order of their acceptance for publication. The manuscripts approved by the editorial board are transferred to the executive secretary to form the issue of the journal.</p>
            <p>If one of the reviewers provided a positive conclusion on the manuscript, and the second – a negative one, then the manuscript is sent by the scientific editor to the third reviewer or a member of the editorial board, who is an expert in the subject of the manuscript. If a third reviewer or a member of the editorial board provides a positive conclusion, the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of the publication of the manuscript is made by the scientific editor of the International Journal of Biology and Chemistry.</p>
            <p>In the case of two negative reviews, the manuscript deviates from publication in the journal.</p>
            <p>The materials of articles rejected by the editorial board based on the results of peer-review are not used by the editorial board for their own purposes. The editor or executive secretary notifies the corresponding author about the rejection and sends the conclusions of the reviewers.</p>
            <p>The manuscript reviews are stored for three years in electronic format on the journal's electronic platform.</p>
            <p>The period for reviewing is assigned by the editor responsible for the article, and the period for reviewing the manuscript by the reviewers is no more than two months from the date of sending the material to the reviewers.</p>
